Learning chess is a pain in the butt. I know the basic rules, but doing anything complicated? I’m really not that great yet. However, I’ve been looking for a game that can challenge me a bit and give me a hobby besides my university and computer science endeavours.

So far, I have played about 50 or so games on chess.com, and my ELO in rapid is about 580. I did play a little bit growing up, so I can hold my own every now and then, and I know some very basic opening moves and counter moves. But more or less, I’m probably losing more than winning.

To get better, I’ve got a few ideas. I’ve considered using Anki to memorise as many opening positions as possible and learning the sequence of moves. I might even set up scenarios with common board positions and take the best move from Stockfish or whatever the top engine is right now and just memorise that. I could also buy premium on chess.com and use their lessons and various resources.

I’ll keep this blog updated with my progress, in addition to all the other things I enjoy doing, and try to make it educational and helpful for others.
