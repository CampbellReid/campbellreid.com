I've always grappled with finding a sense of purpose, questioning what makes my actions noble enough to overcome emotional and mental obstacles. Consistently, I return to the idea that I have an innate desire to make the world a better place. While wealth and financial success are appealing, I find myself uncertain about what to do once I achieve those goals. Ultimately, I believe that by striving to improve the world, I will always have a meaningful purpose.

As a software developer, I possess a unique skill set that allows me to build and deploy projects quickly, and I can also explore other fields, such as robotics and natural language processing. This versatility gives me considerable potential to make a significant impact. I've been pondering whether to focus on proprietary projects or contribute more to open source. I realise there is no definitive answer, but I believe in establishing a strong foundation that can support further projects sustainably.

Given my current situation as a student, I mainly work on university projects and contribute them to open source. However, moving forward, if I develop ideas that could make a substantial difference, I may choose to make them proprietary. My goal would be to price them fairly, ensuring they genuinely improve people's lives without exploiting them. By doing so, I could create a sustainable model that funds future projects, allowing me to pursue increasingly ambitious goals.

I understand that focusing solely on proprietary projects might lead to regrets about not sharing my work freely. Yet, I also recognise the need to support myself financially to make a meaningful impact. It's a harsh reality of our capitalist society, and while I don't entirely disdain capitalism, I must find a way to sustain my efforts. By creating solutions that enhance people's lives and asking for fair compensation, I can scale my influence and continue making a difference.

Balancing between proprietary and open-source projects is crucial. I aim to avoid unethical practices, such as selling users' information or creating unnecessary products. Instead, I want to offer genuine solutions and seek financial support to keep these projects alive and scalable. This approach, I believe, will drive me to achieve more than settling for mediocrity.

In conclusion, my journey as a software developer is driven by the desire to make the world a better place. By carefully navigating between proprietary and open-source projects, I hope to create sustainable solutions that enhance lives while supporting my continuous growth and impact.
