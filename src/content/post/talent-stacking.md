The above video, by Better Than Yesterday, recently appeared in my feed. I'm already a fan of his content, but I thought this looked intriguing; perhaps too good to be true. However, he usually posts quality content, and this was no different.

The core message of his video suggests that you should become competent in multiple, complementary skills, rather than master one to begin with. He argues that there is a lot of competition at the top of a single skill, whereas if you become decent at a few, you effectively create a new market where you're the top dog.

I'm unsure how well this translates into reality, but I think it has a ring of truth. Consequently, I've considered how I can apply these lessons and 'talent stack' myself. I'm already becoming at least average in Computer Science-related topics, so I believe as long as I apply continued effort in this domain, I am covered. However, for other talents, I could use some more. Problem-solving is always a win, so I could practice there. I could also improve my people skills. I think I'm funny, but honing this further could be beneficial. I could improve my networking by attending more events. I could also talent stack by becoming more proficient at putting ideas into the world, no matter how rough, and being rapid about it, a bit like an [indie hacker](https://www.indiehackers.com/). I also have a below-average, but improvable, working Mandarin skill set, so improving this may give me an edge, using things such as [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/).

Overall, I think with how I am desiring to shape my future, talent stacking could be an important change for me.
