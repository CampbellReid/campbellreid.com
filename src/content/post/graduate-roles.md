Applying for graduate roles from university is something I’m struggling with right now. Considering the pressure of university amidst completing applications, it takes a toll. On top of this, I feel I’m struggling with the tests to weed out candidates for roles I know I could succeed in. I’ve been subjected to multiple rounds of spatial reasoning tests, quick math expression evaluation tests, and a few more varieties of such things. 

I could continue writing about my woes and how the world is pitted against me # or I could share my plan to get better at these sorts of tests; that is the content of the rest of this post short post. 

I did some brainstorming work chatgpt to help me improve my spatial reasoning. What I found was that I could be practicing tangrams. The relatively simple plan is to practice these puzzles and, with time, my brain will get feedback to improve its function. This should hopefully improve the function of my parietal lobe, hippocampus, occipital lobe, PFC, and cerebellum. This isn’t important, I just thought it was a fun fact to learn which brain parts I’m improving. 

With this plan, I believe I’ll be equipped to improve my score for this graduate roles and land a career I like.

To cap it off, here is an app which includes a plethora of puzzles which seem to mirror the types of puzzles I encounter in these exams. (Polyforms)[https://apps.apple.com/app/id1403036309]
